# Current Milestone

*Machine-readable. The single most time-sensitive file in this folder — check it is not stale
before trusting anything else in this session.*

> **ARCHIVAL RULE — read before editing this file:** before overwriting this file's content
> for a new milestone, append the outgoing milestone's full summary to
> [`../04_PROJECT_MEMORY/MILESTONE_HISTORY.md`](../04_PROJECT_MEMORY/MILESTONE_HISTORY.md)
> first. This file holds only the *current* milestone — history lives in Project Memory, never

                    unmodified — unlike X.4.4's conflict cascade, this milestone genuinely had a
                    public scorer to reuse. Honest scope gaps, never fabricated: missingEvidence
                    is always [] and unresolvedExceptionCount/unresolvedCrossReferenceCount are
                    always 0, since evidence collection and exception detection remain out of
                    scope for every X.4.x milestone so far. Not wired into ReasoningOrchestrator/
                    LegalReasoningEngine in this milestone — stands alone."

                      Tier 2 more restrictive) — all 5 passed on first run. Unit tests prove the
                      reused scorer fires correctly, evidence-weight aggregation (PRIMARY_BASIS/

                      proven pattern) exercises the first full chain from a raw question string

                      resolveConflicts(), and this milestone's evaluateConfidence() — not fakes
                      at any layer. Architecture guard confirms zero src/knowledge/, src/ai/,
                      src/mcp/, src/conversation/ import; that the stage's only production

     unplanned addendum, tagged v1.0-knowledge-platform"
  - "Final release audit (tag integrity, git fsck, diff scope, Commit 18 reachability) — passed
     5 of 6 checks; one FAIL (diff scope includes 37 pre-existing unrelated commits, not a
     defect, just a scope clarification) — recommendation was still to push"

     knowledge-system-v1.0, pushed"
  - "Zero-Knowledge Validation performed (new-architect simulation, PKS-only source of truth) —
     found ADR-X01 and AIContext schema retrievable only in chat history, not in PKS"
  - "Documentation Completion Sprint: ADR-DRAFT-X01 formalized, AIContext schema + Golden
     Question methodology persisted, SCHEMA.md ownership registry completed, all 15 Knowledge
     Base folders given explicit Ownership/Update Policy — released as v1.1, tagged
     knowledge-system-v1.1, pushed"
  - "Final governance classification: ADR-X02-X07, Golden Question datasets, Knowledge Base
     population, domain legal content, FAQ population, and ontology population confirmed
     intentionally deferred and non-blocking for Phase X.1 — DOCUMENTATION TRACK CLOSED"
  - "PHASE_X_EXECUTION_PLAN.md produced (7-milestone breakdown, X.1-X.7)"
  - "PHASE_X_READINESS_REVIEW.md produced — GO decision, safest-first-task identified as
     conversationTypes.ts"

     SessionStateManager, AdvisoryConversationMemory, MemorySessionRepository, architecture
     guard test — full repo suite green (13760 tests) — FROZEN"
  - "PHASE_X1_POST_IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW.md produced — score 7.9/10, no redesign needed,
     two additive follow-ups recommended for X.2 (composition/rehydration helpers)"
  - "PHASE_X2_IMPLEMENTATION_STRATEGY.md produced — deterministic-first internal build
     sequence (Batch A / Batch B split), Checkpoint A identified as a safe, freeze-able
     stopping point short of LLM integration"
  - "Phase X.2 Batch A (Reasoning Pipeline Core) implemented: reasoningTypes,
     intentPatternRegistry, intentDetector, ruleEngine, evidenceCollector, citationFormatter,

     guard test — full repo suite green (13809 tests) — FROZEN"

     non-blocking recommendations, including a real correction (Finding A) to the previously-
     stated AIContextBuilder integration design"

     ratified; three additional integration-shape gaps found and documented"
  - "ADR-X01_FINAL.md produced (critical re-review, not a rubber stamp): reconfirmed the

     just fixtures — full repo suite green (13943 tests) — FROZEN"

     knowledgeResolutionPlanner, resolveKnowledgeWarnings, IntentResolutionPipeline (depends
     only on IKnowledgeRepository, never the concrete adapter), architecture guard — full repo
     suite green (13971 tests) — FROZEN"
  - "Phase X.3.4 (Knowledge Resolution: Knowledge Ranking & Selection) implemented:
     rankingStrategy (5 per-item criteria), candidateSelector (deterministic sort + itemId
     tie-break), rankingPlanner (per-intent weights), KnowledgeRankingPipeline (consumes only
     the ResolvedKnowledge value, never X.3.2/X.3.3 modules), architecture guard — full repo
     suite green (14011 tests) — FROZEN"
  - "Phase X.3.5 (Knowledge Resolution: Orchestration Wiring) implemented:
     resolutionOrchestrationTypes (RankedKnowledge, ResolutionExecutor), resolutionExecutor
     (thin adapters for IntentResolutionPipeline/KnowledgeRankingPipeline), ResolutionCoordinator
     (sequences intent-retrieval then ranking, no branching), KnowledgeResolutionPipeline (public
     composition root, composes X.3.3/X.3.4 via their existing build*() factories only) —
     zero modification to X.3.1-X.3.4, zero new reasoning logic, architecture guard — full repo

     EXPIRED classification), ruleMetadataParser + thresholdMetadataParser (ADR-022 Decision 5 —
     JSON metadata parsing into RuleKnowledgeItemRef/ThresholdKnowledgeItemRef, critical
     MissingEvidence on failure, never throws), knowledgeApplicabilityEvaluator (final per-item
     verdict), resolutionDiagnostics (aggregation), knowledgeEnrichmentPipeline (enrichKnowledge()

     finalKnowledgeResolutionPipeline (FinalKnowledgeResolutionPipeline,
     buildFinalKnowledgeResolutionPipeline() — composes X.3.5's KnowledgeResolutionPipeline
     [already Intent Resolution -> Retrieval -> Ranking] piped into X.3.6's enrichKnowledge(),
     zero adapter code needed, resolutionCoordinator.ts/resolutionExecutor.ts deliberately not
     touched) — zero modification to X.3.1-X.3.6, end-to-end tests proving the full 4-stage
     deterministic chain plus a regression test proving X.3.5's own pipeline is unchanged,
     architecture guard — full repo suite green (14079 tests) — FROZEN — Phase X.3 (Knowledge
     Resolution) is now a complete, standalone, deterministic pipeline"
  - "PHASE_X3_FINAL_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md produced: no redesign recommended, 8.1/10 average
     across 18 categories, six findings (F-1 unreused ResolutionExecutor/Coordinator
     abstraction, F-2 missingEvidence reconciliation gap, F-3 rule/threshold parser
     duplication, F-4 a stray switch statement inconsistent with the project's own Map-lookup
     convention, F-5 three-deep type aliasing, F-6 uncached per-item metadata parsing) logged
     for awareness, none blocking"
  - "PHASE_X4_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_FINAL.md produced: renamed the still-unbuilt 'reasoning-engine
     wiring' milestone to Phase X.3.8 (X.4 already means Output Validation, built and frozen);
     recommended one milestone, one new composition file, no split; identified the double-
     detectIntent() call as the one concrete integration risk"
  - "PHASE_X4_API_REVIEW.md produced: re-examined the double-detectIntent() finding first-
     principles rather than accepting it as permanent debt — grepped and confirmed reason() had
     exactly one caller anywhere in the repo (its own test file), making this the cheapest
     possible moment to fix the signature; recommended the small, compatible redesign this
     cleanup implements"
  - "Pre-X.3.8 API Cleanup implemented: reasoningTypes.ts's ILegalReasoningEngine.reason() and
     legalReasoningEngine.ts's implementation changed to accept intent: ReasoningIntent instead
     of question: ReasoningQuestion, removing the internal detectIntent() call entirely (reused
     the existing ReasoningIntent type, no new ResolvedIntent/DTO); legal-reasoning-engine.test.ts
     updated mechanically at 7 call sites, zero assertion changes; one incidental fix
     (question.outputFormat had no ReasoningIntent equivalent — reason() now always composes
     the default DECISION-format explanation) — full repo suite green at the identical
     450/14079 count as the X.3.7 baseline — FROZEN"
  - "Phase X.4.1 (Reasoning Engine Wiring: Batch A) implemented: reasoningOrchestrator.ts

  - "Phase X.4.2 (Reasoning Engine Wiring: Reasoning Context Assembly) implemented:

     legalHierarchyScore() directly for the two pieces that ARE public) — unit tests, parity
     tests proving identical outcomes to the real frozen cascade across all 4 tiers,
     real-platform end-to-end integration test, architecture guard — full repo suite green
