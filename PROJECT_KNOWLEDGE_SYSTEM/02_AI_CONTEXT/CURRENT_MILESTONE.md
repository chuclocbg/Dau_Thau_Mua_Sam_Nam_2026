current_milestone: "Phase X.6 - Tool Calling - FROZEN"
documentation_track_status: "CLOSED"
milestone_declared: 2026-07-07
milestone_evidence:
  scope: "src/reasoning/domain/toolCallingTypes.ts (ToolInvocationDecision, ToolDecider,
         NormalizedToolResult, ToolAugmentedResponse — reuses ToolCall [src/providers/
         ToolRegistry.ts] and ConversationResponse/ReasoningAnswerResult as-is);
         src/reasoning/application/toolCallingStage.ts (runToolCallingStage(),
         neverInvokeTool — a thin orchestration stage consuming X.5's ConversationResponse;
         genuinely reuses src/providers/ToolExecutor.ts's ToolExecutor.execute() [constructor-
         injected, never constructed by this milestone] and src/providers/RetryPolicy.ts's
         RetryPolicy constructor + .sleep() timing directly, with a NEW tool-execution-specific
         retryable-error-code set since RetryPolicy's own isTransient()/isNonRetryable() classify
         a different, LLM-provider vocabulary)."
  scope_exclusion: "Zero reasoning, retrieval, ranking, conflict resolution, confidence
                    computation, citation generation, MCP, Multi-Agent, LLM Adapter, Prompt
                    Building, Output Validation, Production Hardening — confirmed absent by
                    architecture guard. TRANSPARENCY FINDING (direct inspection, not assumed
                    from documentation): src/providers/ToolCallingAgent.ts and
                    src/providers/AgentRuntime.ts already exist under the pre-existing,
                    unrelated 'P6' provider-layer track, but both require an actual LLM call via
                    ProviderManager.chat() and detect tool-call syntax embedded in raw LLM
                    response text — neither applies to Phase X's deterministic, non-LLM-driven
                    pipeline and neither is imported. src/providers/ToolRegistry.ts and
                    src/providers/ToolExecutor.ts ARE genuinely reusable (fully generic, no LLM
                    coupling) and are reused directly, unmodified. Tool REGISTRATION (which real
                    tools exist) is entirely the caller's concern — this milestone never
                    constructs a ToolRegistry or registers a tool of its own; the default
                    ToolDecider (neverInvokeTool) always declines, honestly reflecting that no
                    real tool trigger rule exists yet for this domain rather than fabricating
                    one. NUMBERING NOTE: PHASE_X_EXECUTION_PLAN.md's own X.5 already means Tool
                    Calling (MCP-based) — this milestone's 'Tool Calling' is explicitly distinct
                    from MCP, the same kind of collision already reconciled for X.4/X.5;
                    recorded transparently, tracked under the user's own 'Phase X.6 (Tool
                    Calling)' label for this session. Also noted:
                    PHASE_X4_FINAL_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md, named in this milestone's required
                    reading list, does not exist — only PHASE_X3_FINAL_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md
                    does; flagged transparently, not fabricated."
  files_added: "2 implementation files + 4 test files (30 tests: 12 unit decision/retry/
               normalization/immutability/determinism/timeout, 5 parity tests proving genuine
               delegation to ToolExecutor.execute() and RetryPolicy.sleep()/.maxAttempts rather
               than reimplementation, 3 true end-to-end integration tests against a real
               ToolRegistry/ToolExecutor through the complete ReasoningEnginePipeline +
               formatConversationResponse(), 10 architecture guard)"
  full_suite_result: "485 test files, 14333 tests, 0 failures (pool=forks, full repo, no filter);
                      up from 481 files / 14303 tests at the X.5 freeze baseline"
  exit_criteria_met: "Parity tests prove every invocation attempt is a real
                      ToolExecutor.execute() call (spied, asserted called with the exact ToolCall
                      the decider produced, once per retry attempt) and that backoff sleeps
                      delegate to RetryPolicy.prototype.sleep() (spied, asserted called
                      maxAttempts-1 times with the correct attempt indices) — not reimplemented.
                      Unit tests prove decision logic (default decider never invokes; injected
                      decider's call is honored; shouldInvoke:true with no call is treated as a
                      decline), retry behavior (retryable TOOL_EXECUTION_FAILED retried up to
                      maxAttempts; non-retryable INVALID_ARGUMENTS never retried; retry stops
                      immediately on success), normalization (success/failure shape,
                      errorMessage present only on failure), timeout wiring (timeoutMs passed
                      through to the executor, surfaces as a TIMEOUT failure), deep immutability,
                      non-mutation of the input ConversationResponse, and determinism. A true
                      end-to-end integration test exercises the complete chain — a real intent
                      detector, a real memory-backed IKnowledgePlatform + LegalProvider, the
                      complete native Reasoning Engine, the real Output Formatter, and a real
                      ToolRegistry/ToolExecutor with an actual registered tool — for a
                      tool-declined default path, a real tool invocation, and an empty platform.
                      Architecture guard confirms zero src/knowledge/, src/mcp/,
                      src/conversation/, or src/ai/ import; that the only src/providers/ imports
                      are ToolExecutor.ts/ToolRegistry.ts/RetryPolicy.ts — never

                      input ConversationResponse/ReasoningAnswerResult; and that every prior
                      milestone's frozen-file marker (X.3.1 through X.5, plus answerComposer.ts,
                      responseFormatter.ts, and the pre-existing ToolRegistry/ToolExecutor/

     detectIntent() call as the one concrete integration risk"
  - "PHASE_X4_API_REVIEW.md produced: re-examined the double-detectIntent() finding first-
     principles rather than accepting it as permanent debt — grepped and confirmed reason() had
     exactly one caller anywhere in the repo (its own test file), making this the cheapest
     possible moment to fix the signature; recommended the small, compatible redesign this
     cleanup implements"
  - "Pre-X.3.8 API Cleanup implemented: reasoningTypes.ts's ILegalReasoningEngine.reason() and
     legalReasoningEngine.ts's implementation changed to accept intent: ReasoningIntent instead
     of question: ReasoningQuestion, removing the internal detectIntent() call entirely (reused
     the existing ReasoningIntent type, no new ResolvedIntent/DTO); legal-reasoning-engine.test.ts

     citationGenerationTypes.ts (CitationGenerationResult — reuses FormattedCitation),
     citationGenerationStage.ts (generateCitations() — reuses citationFormatter.ts's own
     exported formatCitations() directly, unlike X.4.4's conflict cascade this milestone
     genuinely had a public builder to reuse; independently derives its required
     AppliedArticle[] input from X.4.5's supportingEvidence/rejectedEvidence and X.4.4's
     conflicts; documented, intentional divergence for superseded items since this milestone's
     input list has no temporal-validity signal) — unit tests, parity tests proving identical
     citation sets to the real frozen engine across 4 scenarios, real-platform end-to-end
     integration test, architecture guard — full repo suite green (14229 tests) — FROZEN"
  - "Phase X.4.7 (Reasoning Engine Wiring: Reasoning Answer Composition) implemented:
     reasoningAnswerTypes.ts (ReasoningAnswerResult — reuses ConfidenceComponents/
     DetectedConflict/FormattedCitation), reasoningAnswerStage.ts (composeAnswer() — reuses
     answerComposer.ts's own exported composeDecision() directly; groups X.4.6's citations into
     primaryCitations/supportingCitations/disputedCitations sections; passes X.4.5's confidence
     and X.4.4's conflicts through unchanged; documented, intentional gap: decision is always
     null since RuleEvaluationResult is not one of this milestone's stated inputs) — unit
     tests, parity tests proving equivalence plus the documented decision-gap divergence,
     real-platform end-to-end integration test, architecture guard — full repo suite green
     (14257 tests) — FROZEN"
  - "Final X.4 Integration implemented: reasoningEnginePipeline.ts (ReasoningEnginePipeline,
     buildReasoningEnginePipeline() — the one public entry point for the complete Reasoning
     Engine, wiring X.3.7's FinalKnowledgeResolutionPipeline through X.4.2-X.4.7's stage
     functions in fixed order; deliberately builds FinalKnowledgeResolutionPipeline directly
     rather than routing through ReasoningOrchestrator/legalReasoningEngine.reason() to avoid
     wasted computation) — true end-to-end integration tests against a real IKnowledgePlatform,
     deterministic replay tests, architecture guard (dependency graph, step ordering,
     frozen-file verification) — full repo suite green (14272 tests) — full X.4-track diff
     scope re-verified (41 files added, 4635 insertions, zero existing lines modified since the
     pre-X.4 baseline) — FROZEN — Phase X.4 (Reasoning Engine Wiring) is now COMPLETE"
  - "Phase X.5 (Output Formatting) implemented: conversationResponseTypes.ts
     (ConversationResponse, ResponseSection, FormattingOptions — reuses ConfidenceLabel),
     outputFormatter.ts (formatConversationResponse() — a pure presentation function; reuses
     answerComposer.ts's buildExplanation()/determineHumanReview() directly, both never called
     by the native pipeline before now; found by direct inspection that 'the existing Output
     Formatter' — src/ai/validation/responseFormatter.ts — is unrelated, operating on the OLD
     LLM-text-validation path, not reusable for ReasoningAnswerResult) — unit tests, parity
     tests proving reuse fidelity, true end-to-end integration + replay tests through the
     complete ReasoningEnginePipeline against a real IKnowledgePlatform, architecture guard —
     full repo suite green (14303 tests) — FROZEN"
  - "Phase X.6 (Tool Calling) implemented: toolCallingTypes.ts (ToolInvocationDecision,
     ToolDecider, NormalizedToolResult, ToolAugmentedResponse — reuses ToolCall from the
     pre-existing, unrelated 'P6' src/providers/ToolRegistry.ts as-is), toolCallingStage.ts
     (runToolCallingStage(), neverInvokeTool — reuses src/providers/ToolExecutor.ts's
     ToolExecutor.execute() [constructor-injected] and src/providers/RetryPolicy.ts's
     RetryPolicy constructor + .sleep() timing directly; supplies its own tool-execution-
     specific retryable-error-code set since RetryPolicy's own isTransient()/isNonRetryable()
     classify a different, LLM-provider-specific vocabulary; found by direct inspection that
     src/providers/ToolCallingAgent.ts/AgentRuntime.ts are NOT reusable — both require an actual
     LLM call via ProviderManager.chat(), out of scope) — unit tests, parity tests proving
     genuine delegation to ToolExecutor.execute()/RetryPolicy.sleep() rather than
     reimplementation, real-platform end-to-end integration tests (real ToolRegistry/
     ToolExecutor with an actual registered tool, through the complete ReasoningEnginePipeline +
     formatConversationResponse()), architecture guard — full repo suite green (14333 tests) —
     FROZEN — you are here"
