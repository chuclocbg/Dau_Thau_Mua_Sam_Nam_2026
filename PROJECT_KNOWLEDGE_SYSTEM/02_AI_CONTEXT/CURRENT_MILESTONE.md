milestone_evidence:
  scope: "src/mcp/domain/mcpTypes.ts (MCPToolDescriptor, MCPRequest, MCPResponse<T>,
         MCPClientError(Code), MCPClientResult<T>, MCPTransport — reuses ToolParameter
         [src/providers/ToolRegistry.ts] for inputSchema as-is, zero lossy conversion needed);
         src/mcp/infrastructure/httpMCPTransport.ts (HttpMCPTransport — the one concrete
         MCPTransport shipped, targets 'Streamable HTTP' MCP, genuinely reuses
         src/providers/RestClient.ts's post() for the network call instead of a second fetch
         wrapper); src/mcp/application/mcpClient.ts (MCPClient — connection lifecycle,
         capability discovery [listTools()], tool execution [callTool()], reuses
         src/providers/RetryPolicy.ts's constructor + .sleep() directly with its own small
         MCP-transport-specific retryable-code set); src/mcp/application/mcpToolAdapter.ts
         (registerMCPTools() — the single composition point: discovers remote tools via
         MCPClient.listTools() and registers each as an ordinary ToolDefinition into the SAME,
         already-frozen src/providers/ToolRegistry.ts that local tools use, with a handler that
         forwards to MCPClient.callTool() and throws on failure — so ToolExecutor/
         ToolCallingStage need zero MCP-awareness and zero changes)."
  scope_exclusion: "Zero reasoning, retrieval, ranking, conflict resolution, confidence
                    computation, citation generation, Multi-Agent, LLM Adapter, Prompt Building,
                    Output Validation, Production Hardening — confirmed absent by architecture
                    guard. TRANSPARENCY FINDING (direct inspection, not assumed from
                    documentation): PHASE_X_EXECUTION_PLAN.md's own 'X.5 — Tool Calling' section
                    already reserves the src/mcp/ directory and src/mcp/domain/mcpTypes.ts
                    specifically, but for a DIFFERENT design (IMCPTool/MCPExecutionContext/
                    MCPToolResult feeding a from-scratch MCPToolRegistry + MCPGateway mirroring
                    ProviderRegistry, plus an authPermissionBridge.ts). That design predates
                    Phase X.6 (Tool Calling) — it had no ToolRegistry/ToolExecutor/RetryPolicy
                    application-layer stage to reuse yet. This milestone's live instructions
                    explicitly forbid duplicating Tool Calling, Provider interfaces, or
                    RetryPolicy and require reusing ToolExecutor/ToolRegistry/RetryPolicy — a
                    parallel MCPToolRegistry/MCPGateway would violate that directly, so the
                    directory path is honored but the internal design is not; auth/permission
                    enforcement is correspondingly left as open future work, not fabricated as
                    handled. Also noted: REJECTED_DESIGNS.md's 'Rejected: Building MCP and
                    Multi-Agent Now' entry rejected MCP on TIMING grounds only ('no production
                    usage data exists yet'), not the design — this milestone's explicit
                    authorization is the stated resolution path, not a reversal. Also noted (same
                    as X.6's freeze): PHASE_X4_FINAL_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md, named in this
                    milestone's required reading list, does not exist — only
                    PHASE_X3_FINAL_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md does; flagged transparently."

  exit_criteria_met: "Parity tests prove MCPClient's backoff genuinely delegates to

                      correct attempt indices) and that HttpMCPTransport genuinely delegates the
                      network call to RestClient.post() (spied, asserted called with a
                      JSON-RPC-shaped body against the configured endpoint) — neither
                      reimplemented. Unit tests prove connection lifecycle (DISCONNECTED ->
                      CONNECTED, double-connect/disconnect-when-disconnected rejected),
                      capability discovery (NOT_CONNECTED guard, well-formed tools/list parsing,

                      hanging transport, TRANSPORT_ERROR retried up to maxAttempts, PROTOCOL_ERROR
                      never retried, retry stops on success). A true end-to-end integration test
                      exercises the complete chain — Question -> Reasoning -> Output Formatting
                      -> Tool Calling -> MCP Adapter -> a fake-but-protocol-faithful 'External
                      MCP Server' (a real MCPTransport implementation, not a mock of MCPClient)
                      -> Normalized Tool Result -> Conversation Response — for a successful
                      remote tool invocation, an MCP tool-call error normalized through the exact
                      same TOOL_EXECUTION_FAILED path as any local tool, and a tool-declined
                      default path. Architecture guard confirms zero src/knowledge/, src/ai/, or

     possible moment to fix the signature; recommended the small, compatible redesign this

     the existing ReasoningIntent type, no new ResolvedIntent/DTO); legal-reasoning-engine.test.ts

     legalHierarchyScore(), all already-exported from earlier frozen milestones — zero
     reimplemented business logic) — unit tests, real-platform end-to-end integration test,
     architecture guard — full repo suite green (14144 tests) — FROZEN"
  - "Phase X.4.4 (Reasoning Engine Wiring: Reasoning Conflict Resolution) implemented:
     conflictResolutionTypes.ts (RejectedCandidateEntry, ConflictResolutionResult — reuses
     DetectedConflict/ConflictingItem/ConflictResolution), conflictResolutionStage.ts
     (resolveConflicts() — a from-scratch, byte-for-byte-verified re-expression of
     legalReasoningEngine.ts's private, non-exported 4-tier cascade, since no public component
     exists to reuse for it; reuses X.4.3's applicability determination and X.3.4's
     legalHierarchyScore() directly for the two pieces that ARE public) — unit tests, parity
     tests proving identical outcomes to the real frozen cascade across all 4 tiers,
     real-platform end-to-end integration test, architecture guard — full repo suite green

  - "Phase X.4.5 (Reasoning Engine Wiring: Reasoning Confidence Scoring) implemented:
     confidenceEvaluationTypes.ts (EvidenceWeightSummary, ConfidenceEvaluationResult — reuses
     ConfidenceComponents), confidenceEvaluationStage.ts (evaluateConfidence() — reuses
     answerComposer.ts's own exported computeConfidence() directly, unlike X.4.4's conflict
     cascade this milestone genuinely had a public scorer to reuse; independently derives its
     required appliedDocuments/primaryItemConfidences input via role-assignment bookkeeping
     mirroring legalReasoningEngine.ts's own private algorithm) — unit tests, parity tests
     proving identical confidence scores to the real frozen engine across 5 scenarios,
     real-platform end-to-end integration test, architecture guard — full repo suite green

  - "Phase X.4.6 (Reasoning Engine Wiring: Reasoning Citation Generation) implemented:
     citationGenerationTypes.ts (CitationGenerationResult — reuses FormattedCitation),
     citationGenerationStage.ts (generateCitations() — reuses citationFormatter.ts's own
     exported formatCitations() directly, unlike X.4.4's conflict cascade this milestone
     genuinely had a public builder to reuse; independently derives its required
     AppliedArticle[] input from X.4.5's supportingEvidence/rejectedEvidence and X.4.4's
     conflicts; documented, intentional divergence for superseded items since this milestone's
     input list has no temporal-validity signal) — unit tests, parity tests proving identical
     citation sets to the real frozen engine across 4 scenarios, real-platform end-to-end
     integration test, architecture guard — full repo suite green (14229 tests) — FROZEN"
  - "Phase X.4.7 (Reasoning Engine Wiring: Reasoning Answer Composition) implemented:
     reasoningAnswerTypes.ts (ReasoningAnswerResult — reuses ConfidenceComponents/
     DetectedConflict/FormattedCitation), reasoningAnswerStage.ts (composeAnswer() — reuses
     answerComposer.ts's own exported composeDecision() directly; groups X.4.6's citations into
     primaryCitations/supportingCitations/disputedCitations sections; passes X.4.5's confidence
     and X.4.4's conflicts through unchanged; documented, intentional gap: decision is always
     null since RuleEvaluationResult is not one of this milestone's stated inputs) — unit
     tests, parity tests proving equivalence plus the documented decision-gap divergence,
     real-platform end-to-end integration test, architecture guard — full repo suite green
     (14257 tests) — FROZEN"
  - "Final X.4 Integration implemented: reasoningEnginePipeline.ts (ReasoningEnginePipeline,
     buildReasoningEnginePipeline() — the one public entry point for the complete Reasoning
     Engine, wiring X.3.7's FinalKnowledgeResolutionPipeline through X.4.2-X.4.7's stage
     functions in fixed order; deliberately builds FinalKnowledgeResolutionPipeline directly
     rather than routing through ReasoningOrchestrator/legalReasoningEngine.reason() to avoid
     wasted computation) — true end-to-end integration tests against a real IKnowledgePlatform,
     deterministic replay tests, architecture guard (dependency graph, step ordering,
     frozen-file verification) — full repo suite green (14272 tests) — full X.4-track diff
     scope re-verified (41 files added, 4635 insertions, zero existing lines modified since the
     pre-X.4 baseline) — FROZEN — Phase X.4 (Reasoning Engine Wiring) is now COMPLETE"
  - "Phase X.5 (Output Formatting) implemented: conversationResponseTypes.ts
     (ConversationResponse, ResponseSection, FormattingOptions — reuses ConfidenceLabel),
     outputFormatter.ts (formatConversationResponse() — a pure presentation function; reuses
     answerComposer.ts's buildExplanation()/determineHumanReview() directly, both never called
     by the native pipeline before now; found by direct inspection that 'the existing Output
     Formatter' — src/ai/validation/responseFormatter.ts — is unrelated, operating on the OLD
     LLM-text-validation path, not reusable for ReasoningAnswerResult) — unit tests, parity
     tests proving reuse fidelity, true end-to-end integration + replay tests through the
     complete ReasoningEnginePipeline against a real IKnowledgePlatform, architecture guard —
     full repo suite green (14303 tests) — FROZEN"
  - "Phase X.6 (Tool Calling) implemented: toolCallingTypes.ts (ToolInvocationDecision,
     ToolDecider, NormalizedToolResult, ToolAugmentedResponse — reuses ToolCall from the
     pre-existing, unrelated 'P6' src/providers/ToolRegistry.ts as-is), toolCallingStage.ts
     (runToolCallingStage(), neverInvokeTool — reuses src/providers/ToolExecutor.ts's
     ToolExecutor.execute() [constructor-injected] and src/providers/RetryPolicy.ts's
     RetryPolicy constructor + .sleep() timing directly; supplies its own tool-execution-
     specific retryable-error-code set since RetryPolicy's own isTransient()/isNonRetryable()
     classify a different, LLM-provider-specific vocabulary; found by direct inspection that
     src/providers/ToolCallingAgent.ts/AgentRuntime.ts are NOT reusable — both require an actual
     LLM call via ProviderManager.chat(), out of scope) — unit tests, parity tests proving
     genuine delegation to ToolExecutor.execute()/RetryPolicy.sleep() rather than
     reimplementation, real-platform end-to-end integration tests (real ToolRegistry/
     ToolExecutor with an actual registered tool, through the complete ReasoningEnginePipeline +
     formatConversationResponse()), architecture guard — full repo suite green (14333 tests) —
     FROZEN"
  - "Phase X.7 (MCP Integration) implemented: mcpTypes.ts (MCPToolDescriptor, MCPRequest,
     MCPResponse<T>, MCPClientError(Code), MCPClientResult<T>, MCPTransport — reuses
     ToolParameter for inputSchema as-is), httpMCPTransport.ts (HttpMCPTransport — the one
     concrete MCPTransport shipped, reuses src/providers/RestClient.ts's post() for the network
     call), mcpClient.ts (MCPClient — connection lifecycle, capability discovery, tool
     execution; reuses RetryPolicy's constructor + .sleep() directly with its own MCP-transport-
     specific retryable-code set), mcpToolAdapter.ts (registerMCPTools() — the single
     composition point: discovers remote tools and registers each as an ordinary ToolDefinition
     into the SAME, already-frozen src/providers/ToolRegistry.ts that local tools use, so
     ToolExecutor/ToolCallingStage need zero MCP-awareness and zero changes; found by direct
     inspection that PHASE_X_EXECUTION_PLAN.md's own pre-planned MCPToolRegistry/MCPGateway
     design, drafted before Phase X.6 existed, would have duplicated Tool Calling/ToolRegistry —
     not built; the src/mcp/ directory reservation was honored, the internal design was not) —
     unit tests, parity tests proving genuine delegation to RetryPolicy.sleep()/RestClient.post()
     rather than reimplementation, a true end-to-end integration test against a fake-but-
     protocol-faithful in-memory MCP server through a real ToolRegistry/ToolExecutor/
     ToolCallingStage/ReasoningEnginePipeline/OutputFormatter, architecture guard — full repo
     suite green (14366 tests) — FROZEN — you are here"
