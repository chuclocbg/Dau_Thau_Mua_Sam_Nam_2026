milestone_evidence:
  scope: "src/multiagent/domain/multiAgentTypes.ts (WorkerTask, WorkerOutcome, CoordinationRun,
         CoordinatorOptions/Result/Error — reuses RetryOptions [src/providers/RetryPolicy.ts]
         rather than a parallel options shape); src/multiagent/application/taskScheduler.ts
         (validateTasks(), buildWaves() — pure, deterministic duplicate-id/missing-dependency/
         cycle validation and Kahn's-BFS wave grouping, zero reasoning-layer knowledge);
         src/multiagent/application/coordinatorAgent.ts (CoordinatorAgent.run() — parallel wave
         scheduling, dependency-result aggregation, per-task timeout via Promise.race,
         AbortSignal-based cancellation, fail-fast on first failure; reuses RetryPolicy's
         constructor + .sleep() directly for uniform per-task retry, since a WorkerTask is an
         opaque callback with no per-task error-code vocabulary to classify against);
         src/multiagent/application/reasoningWorkerAdapter.ts (buildReasoningWorkerTask() — the
         single composition point: wraps the real, frozen chain
         ReasoningEnginePipeline.answer() -> formatConversationResponse() ->
         runToolCallingStage() into one WorkerTask.execute() callback)."
  scope_exclusion: "Zero reasoning, retrieval, ranking, conflict resolution, confidence
                    computation, citation generation, Tool Calling, MCP, formatting logic
                    reimplemented anywhere in multiAgentTypes.ts/taskScheduler.ts/
                    coordinatorAgent.ts (confirmed: zero src/reasoning/, src/knowledge/,
                    src/mcp/, src/ai/, src/conversation/ import in any of the three). TRANSPARENCY
                    FINDING (direct inspection, not assumed from documentation):
                    src/providers/MultiAgentCoordinator.ts (pre-existing, unrelated 'P6' track,
                    P6-10V) already implements agent registration + topological task scheduling,
                    but its AgentTask/AgentDefinition model requires an
                    AgentRuntime.run(prompt) — an actual LLM call via ProviderManager, i.e.
                    literal independent reasoning per agent. This milestone's own explicit rule
                    ('Agents NEVER perform reasoning independently. Reasoning remains
                    centralized.') forbids exactly that, so MultiAgentCoordinator.ts is not
                    imported or reused; CoordinatorAgent/taskScheduler.ts are new, deterministic,
                    LLM-free orchestration code — legitimate new work for this milestone's own
                    stated deliverable (task decomposition/parallel scheduling/dependency
                    tracking), not a duplication of anything this milestone is told never to
                    duplicate. REJECTED_DESIGNS.md's 'Rejected: Multi-LLM-Agent Conversations'
                    already made the same decision project-wide ('deterministic upstream
                    orchestration with exactly one LLM synthesis call' over LLM-to-LLM hops) —
                    this milestone's design is consistent with, not a reversal of, that
                    rejection. Also noted: 'Rejected: Building MCP and Multi-Agent Now' rejected
                    Multi-Agent on TIMING grounds only ('no production usage data exists yet'),
                    not the design — this milestone's explicit authorization is the stated
                    resolution path. ARCHITECTURE NOTE on the diagram order given for this
                    milestone ('Reasoning Engine -> Tool Calling -> MCP -> Output Formatting'):
                    the REAL, already-frozen order (Reasoning -> Output Formatting -> Tool
                    Calling, with MCP-sourced tools already folded one layer below Tool Calling
                    per X.7) is preserved in reasoningWorkerAdapter.ts rather than reordering
                    frozen stages to match the diagram's prose — reordering would itself be a
                    frozen-milestone modification, explicitly forbidden; recorded transparently."

  exit_criteria_met: "Unit tests prove task decomposition validation (duplicate ids, missing
                      dependencies, self/two-node/diamond-graph cycles), deterministic parallel
                      scheduling (independent tasks run concurrently, verified by interleaved
                      timing; a diamond graph schedules in the correct wave order), dependency
                      tracking (a dependency's completed value is passed to its dependent),
                      fail-fast failure handling (a failure aborts scheduling of any wave not yet
                      started), timeout handling (a hanging task is marked FAILED via
                      taskTimeoutMs), cancellation (AbortSignal aborted before or during a run
                      marks the run CANCELLED and stops scheduling further waves), and retry
                      orchestration (uniform retry up to maxAttempts, stops on success). A parity
                      test proves CoordinatorAgent's backoff genuinely delegates to
                      RetryPolicy.prototype.sleep() (spied, called maxAttempts-1 times with
                      correct attempt indices) rather than being reimplemented. A deterministic-
                      replay test proves identical task batches produce identical outcome
                      sequences (aside from runId/timestamps). A true end-to-end integration test
                      dispatches multiple real reasoning-engine workers in parallel (via
                      buildReasoningWorkerTask()) against a real memory-backed
                      IKnowledgePlatform + LegalProvider, the complete ReasoningEnginePipeline,

     Engine, wiring X.3.7's FinalKnowledgeResolutionPipeline through X.4.2-X.4.7's stage

     ToolExecutor.execute() [constructor-injected] and src/providers/RetryPolicy.ts's
     RetryPolicy constructor + .sleep() timing directly; supplies its own tool-execution-
     specific retryable-error-code set since RetryPolicy's own isTransient()/isNonRetryable()

     ToolParameter for inputSchema as-is), httpMCPTransport.ts (HttpMCPTransport — the one
     concrete MCPTransport shipped, reuses src/providers/RestClient.ts's post() for the network
     call), mcpClient.ts (MCPClient — connection lifecycle, capability discovery, tool
     execution; reuses RetryPolicy's constructor + .sleep() directly with its own MCP-transport-

     composition point: discovers remote tools and registers each as an ordinary ToolDefinition
     into the SAME, already-frozen src/providers/ToolRegistry.ts that local tools use, so
     ToolExecutor/ToolCallingStage need zero MCP-awareness and zero changes; found by direct
     inspection that PHASE_X_EXECUTION_PLAN.md's own pre-planned MCPToolRegistry/MCPGateway
     design, drafted before Phase X.6 existed, would have duplicated Tool Calling/ToolRegistry —
     not built; the src/mcp/ directory reservation was honored, the internal design was not) —
     unit tests, parity tests proving genuine delegation to RetryPolicy.sleep()/RestClient.post()
     rather than reimplementation, a true end-to-end integration test against a fake-but-

     src/providers/MultiAgentCoordinator.ts requires an LLM call via AgentRuntime.run(prompt) —
     literal independent reasoning per agent, exactly what this milestone's own rule forbids — so
     it is not reused; new, deterministic, LLM-free scheduling code was written instead, matching
     REJECTED_DESIGNS.md's own prior 'Rejected: Multi-LLM-Agent Conversations' decision),
     reasoningWorkerAdapter.ts (buildReasoningWorkerTask() — the single composition point:
     wraps the real, frozen chain ReasoningEnginePipeline.answer() ->

     scheduling, dependency tracking, fail-fast, timeout, cancellation, retry orchestration with
     a RetryPolicy.sleep() parity assertion, deterministic replay), a true end-to-end integration
